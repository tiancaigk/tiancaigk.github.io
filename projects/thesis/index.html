This research trageted on players of Tom Clancy’s The Division 2\r, a tactical shooter action role-playing video game selling over 10 million copies worldwide, primarily aimed to address:\nHow can players’ perceived experiences of playing The Division 2 affect their in-game behaviors? Research methodology In this study, survey and telemetry data were utilized to operationalize the two main target variables: player motivation and player behavior.\nSurvey The Ubisoft Perceived Experiences Questionnaire (UPEQ)\rwas a psychometric instrument developed by Azadvar \u0026 Canossa (2018) to measure if if 4 basic psychological needs (i.e., Autonomy,Competence, Relatedness, and Presence) are satisfied through playing video games.\nThe questionnair is originally in English, validated by reliability test and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the UPEQ was also translated into Chinese before the formal distribution for reaching out to a more diverse sample.\nTelemetry data The aggregated game metrics below covered most in-game behaviors and could be categorized as 3 types: playtime, progression, and DLC gameplay.\nData collection The whole data collection process was GDPR compliant.\n10,000 random active players across the globe who at least played one time during the month prior to the survey distribution were selected as the sample pool. By tracking their user ids, the UPEQ survey plus several demographic questions were distributed to each player via email through the CRM pipeline. The players were informed that the survey was targered on their play experiences of The Division 2.\nThe telemetry data were extarcted through the offical game date bases. The survey responses were linked with the telemetry data by user ids.\n269 players filled the survey, after cleaning outliers/over-consistent responses, 148 players remianed as the final sample size. The demographic characteristics of the respondents can be found here\r.\nData analysis Hierarchical Linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied to the data set to explore if player motivations were predictive of the in-game behaviors.

Immersion could facilitate engagement: if players are more immersed in the game, it is more likely for them to level up faster (i.e., invest more time during early stages) Players purchase more content for challenges: whether players buy season-pass can be significantly predicted by Competence scores. “If I feel effective and capable while playing, I would buy more content.” ","wordCount":"518","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yuanjun"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tiancaigk.github.io/projects/thesis/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yuanjun's Home","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tiancaigk.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tiancaigk.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/packwar title=Packwar><span>Packwar</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/search title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tiancaigk.github.io/projects/>Projects</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Quantitative UX research - Tom Clancy's The Division 2</h1><div class=post-meta>518 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Yuanjun&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/projects/thesis.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank></a></div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#research-objective>Research objective</a></li><li><a href=#research-methodology>Research methodology</a><ul><li><a href=#survey>Survey</a></li><li><a href=#telemetry-data>Telemetry data</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#data-collection>Data collection</a></li><li><a href=#data-analysis>Data analysis</a></li><li><a href=#key-findings>Key findings</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><blockquote><p>This is the Master Thesis project that I completed at <a href=https://www.massive.se/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Massive Entertainment - A Ubisoft Studio</a>
